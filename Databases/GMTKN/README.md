**Notes:** General database from Grimme. Reference values are from different sources. This database superseeds the previous versions, which include GMTKN24 and GMTKN30. Some subsets are overlapping with Berkeley and with W4-17 (think W4-11, which is in Berkeley and is superseded by W4-17). Some subsets use the same geometries but have slightly different values than some Minnesota ones, due to different opinions in benchmarking techniques (for example DBH76 and ISOL24). MB08-165 is superseded by MB16-43, however it's also included here because it is still quite useful.
